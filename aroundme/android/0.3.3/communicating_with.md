# Communicating with

## Journey

This module communicates with [Journey]({{ site.baseurl }}/journey/) module in order to get directions for a chosen itinerary. You should enable the `Go from/Go to` feature when first initializing the module by calling `AroundMeUI.getInstance().withGoFromGoTo()`.\
The `Router` module should be initialized also with the right parameters since itâ€™s mandatory to build the connection between these modules:

```kotlin
if (!Router.getInstance().isInit) {
    Router.getInstance()
        .register(aroundMe = AroundMeUI.getInstance().aroundMeActivityDelegate)
        .register(journey = JourneysUI.getInstance().activityDelegate)
        .init()
}
```

When the user taps on a marker on the map, the buttons `Go from` and `Go to` should pop up as follows:

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/aroundme_android_go_fromto.png" alt="Map screen" width="350"/>

Clicking on one of the buttons will redirect the user to Journey module with the given origin/destination.
