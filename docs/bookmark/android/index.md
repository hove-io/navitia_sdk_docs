# Bookmark Android

## üíª Setup

Add the following dependencies in the `build.gradle` file of your application:

``` groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("com.kisio.navitia.sdk.ui:bookmark:1.6.0")
}
```

The activity launching Bookmark must handle the following configuration changes: `orientation|screenSize` declared into your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

``` xml
<activity
    android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize"/>
```

## üë®‚Äçüíª  Implementation

‚ö†Ô∏è Please make sure to read the [modules configuration](../../getting_started/#modules-configuration) section before proceeding!<br>

This module is set up by calling `BookmarkUI.getInstance()`. The singleton behaves like a builder in which each method allows you to configure the module. Then, you need to call the `init()` method at the end. You should call this method in an `Application` subclass.<br>
This method takes the following parameters:

| Name | Required | Description | Type | Default |
| --- |:---:| --- | :---: | :---: |
| `context` | :material-check: | Context in which the module is launched | `Context` | :material-close: |
| `token` | :material-check: | <a href="https://navitia.io/inscription/" target="_blank">Get your token</a> | `String` | :material-close: |
| `configuration` | :material-close: | Module configuration object | [`AroundMeConfiguration`](../../getting_started/#modules-configuration) | `null` |
| `configurationJsonFile` | :material-close: | Module configuration JSON file name | `String` | `null` |

<h4>Example</h4>

``` kotlin
BookmarkUI.getInstance().let { instance ->
    instance.init(
      context = this,
      token = "your_token",
      configurationJsonFile = "config.json"
   )
}
```

### Navigation listener

Since the module launches its own fragments, you may want your application to be aware of navigation events.
For that, you have to set a navigation listener by calling this method before `init()`.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.setNavigationListener(bookmarkNavigationListenerImpl)` | Set the class instance implementing `BookmarkNavigationListener` interface |

This interface gives you the method `onBack()` for any back event between two fragments and the method `onNavigate` for the reverse.
Each method has a `BookmarkNavigationListener.Event` parameter you can rely on.

| Event |
| --- |
| `ADD_ADDRESS_BACK_TO_FAVORITES` |
| `EXTERNAL_TO_FAVORITES` |
| `FAVORITES_BACK_TO_EXTERNAL` |
| `FAVORITES_TO_JOURNEY` |
| `FAVORITES_TO_ADD_ADDRESS` |
| `FAVORITES_TO_ROADMAP` |

## üöÄ  Launching

Bookmark has a single entry point `FavoriteFragment`.<br>
Assuming you have an `Activity` with a fragment container, refer to the following example to launch the entry screen fragment:

``` kotlin
supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction().run {
    replace(R.id.container_id, FavoriteFragment.newInstance(), "TAG")
    addToBackStack("TAG")
    commit()
}
```

## üì± Screens

### Favorites

This screen lists all the favorite stations, Bike sharing service stations, car parkings and addresses added by the user through other UI modules (Around Me, Schedule...) or from within a 3rd party application.<br>

## üì¢ Communicating with other modules

### Journey

This module communicates with [Journey](../../journey/) module in order to get directions for a chosen itinerary. You should enable the `go_from_go_to` parameter in the [features configuration](../../getting_started/#around-me-features).<br>
When the user taps on a marker on the map, the buttons **Go from there** and **Go to there** should pop up as follows:

<img class="img-overview" src="/navitia_sdk_docs/assets/img/bookmark_android_go_fromto.png" alt="Go from/to">

Clicking on one of the buttons will redirect the user to Journey module with the given origin/destination.<br>
