# Around Me Android

## üíª Setup

Add the following dependency in the `build.gradle` file of your application:

``` groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("com.kisio.navitia.sdk.ui:aroundme:2.0.0")
}
```

For the use of cartography, add your Google Maps API Key to your `AndroidManifest.xml` as well. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your key:

``` xml
<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/> <!-- (1) -->
```

1.  Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your Google Maps API Key

The activity launching Around Me must handle the following configuration changes: `orientation|screenSize` declared into your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

``` xml
<activity
    android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize"/>
```

## üë®‚Äçüíª  Implementation

‚ö†Ô∏è Please make sure to read the [modules configuration](../../getting_started/#modules-configuration) section before proceeding!<br>

This module is set up by calling `AroundMeUI.getInstance()`. The singleton behaves like a builder in which each method allows you to configure the module. Then, you need to call the `init()` method at the end.<br>
This method takes the following parameters:

| Name | Required | Description | Type | Default |
| --- |:---:| --- | :---: | :---: |
| `context`| :material-check: | Context in which the module is launched | `Context` | :material-close: |
| `configuration`| :material-close: | Module configuration object | [`AroundMeConfiguration`](../../getting_started/#modules-configuration) | `null` |
| `configurationJsonFile`| :material-close: | Module configuration JSON file name | `String` | `null` |
| `onNavigate`| :material-close: | Listener for the navigation between module screens | `Unit` | `{ _ -> }` |
| `onBack`| :material-close: | Listener for the navigation back button click event | `Unit` | `{ _ -> }` |

<h4>Example</h4>

``` kotlin
AroundMeUI.getInstance().let { instance ->
    instance.init(
      context = this,
      configurationJsonFile = "config.json"
   )
   instance.attachActivity(this)
}
```

### Activity delegation

Since the module launches its fragments, you may want to execute their `onBackPressed()` from your activity.
For that, you have to attach the activity that will host fragments to `AroundMeUI.getInstance()`. This will provide a delegate which will execute `onBackPressed()` on the displayed fragment.<br>
You can call this method before or after `init()`.

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.attachActivity(AppCompatActivity)` | Attach the activity that will host Around Me fragments |

Then, you can call `AroundMeUI.getInstance().delegate` to obtain the delegate.
If you try to access it without attaching an activity before, an exception will be thrown.

``` kotlin
AroundMeUI.getInstance().attachActivity(AppCompatActivity)
AroundMeUI.getInstance().delegate.onBackPressed()
```

## üöÄ  Launching

Around Me has a single entry point `MapFragment`.<br>
Assuming you have an `Activity` with a fragment container, refer to the following example to launch the entry screen fragment:

``` kotlin
supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction().run {
    replace(R.id.container_id, MapFragment.newInstance(), "TAG")
    addToBackStack("TAG")
    commit()
}
```

## üì± Screens

### Map

The map screen represents the main screen of this module. It shows the places nearby the center of the visible region, draws them on the map and adds them to the bottom sliding panel.<br>
The shown data depend on the selected elements in the [filters](#filters) screen.

### Search

The search screen allows the user to seek for a place using a built-in autocompletion. The result is a selection of addresses, stations and points of interest based on the user search input text.<br>
If an element is selected, this screen will disappear and the map will be centered over the selected item location.
Please note that a history feature is added to this screen, allowing the user to choose from the previous selected items. The `maxHistory` parameter defines the maximum number of items to show in the history list.

### Filters

This screen content is a visual version of the passed transport categories and POI categories configuration (check [modules configuration](../../getting_started/#modules-configuration) section for more information). The selected elements will be used to filter the data received and drawn within the map. One filter should at least be selected or else the user can't apply the current filters configuration.<br><br>
If you want to reset the user filters configuration, you can simply call `AroundMeUI.getInstance().resetUserPreferences()` and the current configuration will be deleted and the screen will be updated according to the new passed configuration.

## üó∫ Navigating

Please refer to the following schema to learn more about different interactions and how to navigate between module screens:

## üì¢ Communicating with other modules

### Journey

This module communicates with [Journey](../../journey/) module in order to get directions for a chosen itinerary. You should enable the `go_from_go_to` parameter in the [features configuration](../../getting_started/#around-me-features).<br>
When the user taps on a marker on the map, the buttons **Go from there** and **Go to there** should pop up as follows:

<img class="img-overview" src="/navitia_sdk_docs/assets/img/aroundme_android_go_fromto.png" alt="Go from/to">

Clicking on one of the buttons will redirect the user to Journey module with the given origin/destination.<br>

Another way to communicate with [Journey](../../journey/) module is through the [Map](#map) screen and precisely the **Where are we going?** button, this feature should also be enabled by setting the `journey_search_mode` in the [features configuration](../../getting_started/#around-me-features) to `true`.<br>

The `Router` module should also be initialized with the right parameters since it‚Äôs mandatory to build the connection between these modules:

``` kotlin
if (!Router.getInstance().isInit) {
    Router.getInstance()
        .register(aroundMe = AroundMeUI.getInstance().delegate)
        .register(journey = JourneysUI.getInstance().delegate)
        .init()
}
```
